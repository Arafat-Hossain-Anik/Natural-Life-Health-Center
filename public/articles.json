        "details": "Antibiotics are considered the keystone of modern medicine, but their excessive use continues to generate unwanted side effects.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) isn’t historically known for using pessimistic language, but lately they’ve been sounding the alarms about the consequences of overusing antibiotics.CDC director Tom Frieden has warned of “nightmare bacteria,” those that have evolved defenses against modern antibiotics. This leads to to strains that can cause fatal infections.While specialists are making strides to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics and to slow potential infections through better policy, the overuse of antibiotics continues to have severe health consequences for the U.S. and around the world."

        "details": "Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by a deficiency of the pancreatic hormone insulin, which result from defects in insulin secretion, or action, or both. Diabetes mellitus Diabetes is a chronic medical condition, meaning that although it can be controlled, it lasts a lifetime. There are three main types of diabetes mellitus: 1. Type 1 DM; 2. Type 2 DM; 3. Gestational diabetes. Endocrinology is a branch of medicine dealing with the endocrine system, its diseases, and its hormones as well as the effect of these hormones on major biological functions such as metabolism, growth and development, sleep, digestion, respiration, excretion, stress, lactation, movement, reproduction, and sensory perception. Pancreas is both endocrine as well as exocrine gland. It secretes hormones such as insulin, glucagon and somatostatin. Endocrinology also focuses on study of the biosynthesis, storage, biochemical and physiological function of hormones and with the cells and tissues of the endocrine glands."

        "details": "There is a whole class of conjectures that, like religion, give us a privileged position in the cosmic scheme of things. Call them we-were-meant-to-be-here theories. They imply that we are not an accidental, incidental part of nature; our existence is somehow necessary. Without us, the universe might not exist. One example is the anthropic principle, which dates back to the 1960s. The anthropic principle suggests that the laws of nature must take the form that we observe because otherwise we would not be here to observe them. The anthropic principle is a tautology masquerading as a truth, but it has proved remarkably resilient. Stephen Hawking took it seriously, as did Weinberg. A major reason for the endurance of the anthropic principle is the proliferation of multiverse theories, which hold that our universe is just one of many. If you buy multiverses (to which I will return below), the anthropic principle can help explain why we find ourselves in this particular universe with these particular laws."
